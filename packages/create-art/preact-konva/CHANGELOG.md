# @create-art/preact-konva

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8188be2: Separate the create-design browser editor from its CLI and server package,
  move shared editor foundations under create-art ownership, and make font-owned
  package directories explicit throughout the workspace. Move the product-neutral
  Preact Konva bindings into the product-neutral `@create-art` scope. Put
  canonical document initialization in the source package and extract headless
  design-model and PDF packages for browser and CLI consumers. Keep the
  fea-rs-wasm build and benchmark scripts runnable from their scoped directory.

### Patch Changes

- c852f02: Declare the repository's MPL library boundary and AGPL application boundary, with explicit permissions for generated assets.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 13eda7d: Add shared authoritative vector gesture state machines and interactive scene components for font and design editing, including complete Pen drafts, Bézier handles, cancellation, shape placement, selection, and coordinate-correct transforms in both y-up and y-down canvases. Keep create-design persistence and history in its document adapter while deferring its Rule tool, and preserve create-font's responsive native Pen transactions and unselected preview marker. Add an issue-linked create-font tool itinerary, mounted interaction-lifecycle regressions, and CI-enforced Vitest coverage floors for the font-tool surface. Keep Pen commits responsive by using shallow revision dependencies for mounted font projections, compiling live fonts only while a Preview tile is present, coalescing whole-source persistence after an edit burst, and moving post-save full-font validation into an incremental source worker so edits do not block the renderer. Restore Shift-marquee selection inversion so every covered node or handle toggles its prior selection state, fully select pasted contours including their authored handles, and keep selected-contour fills, outlines, nodes, and screen-constant selection rings aligned with the pointer while controlled Konva nodes rerender. Let the full-width invisible edge hit target initiate the same selected-contour drag as the visible stroke.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 2abe981: Add precise glyph metrics, node and metric snapping, mixed-control alignment,
  transform-selection bounds, whole-path selection, Pen segment splitting, path
  reversal, and first-node editing with atomic Undo/Redo history.
